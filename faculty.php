					<h2>Welcome to the Faculty of Commerce</h2>
					<p>Faculty of Business of Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT) is the prime choice of students who come for admission here. This faculty is the single largest in terms of student enrollment in every semester. This faculty has the highest number of teachers. There are five major departments under it namely; Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing and Economics providing specialized academic programs. Business education has become increasingly popular over the years because of its graduates are in great demand in the job market. Phenomenal development in the Private sector in Bangladesh has created this momentum. We in BUBT have focused our curricula in line with the needs of the job market. However, a large chunk of our students do not prefer a job rather they opt for starting their own ventures and thus help create jobs for others.</p>
